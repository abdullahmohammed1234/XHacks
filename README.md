Rewind allows users to:

Browse viral trends by year and month

Rediscover cultural moments with On This Day

Create personal memory capsules

Compare trends across years or users

Test pop culture knowledge through quizzes

Receive a personalized wrapped-style recap of their activity

Rewind blends nostalgia, education, and gamification into a single interactive archive.

## Project Theme

Nostalgia as a Product Experience

The design and interaction model are inspired by:

90s and early 2000s aesthetics

This theme creates an emotional connection while encouraging exploration and discovery.
